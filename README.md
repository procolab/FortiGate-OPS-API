The FortiOS REST API is a powerful and flexible way to administer the FortiGate system. API-based management of systems has become one of the most popular, and preferred, methods for MNOs to manage the network equipment.

REST (Representational State Transfer) is a software architectural style that was created to describe the design and guide the development of the architecture for the World Wide Web. REST defines a set of constraints for how the architecture of a distributed, Internet-scale hypermedia system, such as the Web, should behave. The REST architectural style emphasizes uniform interfaces, independent deployment of components, the scalability of interactions between them, and creating a layered architecture to promote caching to reduce user-perceived latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems.

1. GET - The GET method is used to ‘retrieve’ a record or a collection of records from the server.
2. POST - The POST method sends data to create a ‘new record‘ on the server.
3. PUT - The PUT method sends data to update an ‘existing record‘ on the server.
4. PATCH - Like the PUT method, PATCH is also used to send data to update an ‘existing record’ on the server.
5. DELETE - The DELETE method is used to delete record(s) from the server.

All HTTP response status codes are separated into five classes or categories. The first digit of the status code defines the class of response, while the last two digits do not have any classifying or categorization role. There are five classes defined by the standard:

1. 1xx informational response – the request was received, continuing process
2. 2xx successful – the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted
3. 3xx redirection – further action needs to be taken in order to complete the request
4. 4xx client error – the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled
5. 5xx server error – the server failed to fulfil an apparently valid request
